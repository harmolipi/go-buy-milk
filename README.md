# Go Buy Milk
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/go-buy-milk).

## Functionality
This is the [Todo List](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list) project, where I create a Todo List site, which I'm calling "Go Buy Milk".

## Thoughts
Definitely was a more involved process to put this together, and I found myself often missing the things that were made easy with Rails and Active Record. The main challenge was organizing my code as it grew more and more complex. Eventually I was able to complete the basic project requirements, so I'm going to stop there for now. I know that there's room for improvement, between refactoring and adding some new features (like the ability to edit the todo lists), so that'll be something I can return to in the future.

God bless.
